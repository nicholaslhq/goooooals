Users will be able to specify their interests, values, and preferred difficulty levels, allowing the app to recommend customized goals that align with their unique circumstances. _(Note: This feature is not yet implemented but is planned for future development.)_

-   **Subgoals and Customization**:

    -   Users can request detailed breakdowns of their goals into actionable subgoals, making it easier to track progress. Customization options allow users to modify these subgoals or regenerate them to better align with their evolving needs and preferences.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the Goooooals on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

-   **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: This is required to run the app and comes with npm (Node Package Manager). You need Node.js version 14.x or higher.
-   **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)**: This is included with Node.js and is used to manage project dependencies. Alternatively, you can use [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/), which is an optional package manager that some developers prefer.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

    Start by cloning the Goooooals repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    git clone [url]
    ```

    Replace `[url]` with the URL of the repository. This command creates a copy of the project on your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Move into the project directory where the cloned files are located:

    ```bash
    cd goooooals
    ```

3. **Install Project Dependencies**

    Install the necessary libraries and packages required for the app to run. You can use either npm or Yarn:

    - With npm:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

    - With Yarn:
        ```bash
        yarn install
        ```

    This command will download and install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

    The app requires certain environment variables to function correctly. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project if it doesn‚Äôt already exist, and add the following variables:

    - `SMTP_HOST`: The hostname of your SMTP server used for sending emails.
    - `EMAIL_USER`: The username or email address used for authentication with the SMTP server.
    - `EMAIL_PASS`: The password associated with the EMAIL_USER. This is used for authentication when connecting to the SMTP server. _(Note: Sometimes, this may be an app password depending on the user and email provider.)_

    Make sure to replace these placeholders with your actual values.

5. **Start the Development Server**

    Launch the app in development mode. This will start a local server where you can view and interact with the app:

    - With npm:

        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

    - With Yarn:
        ```bash
        yarn dev
        ```

6. **Open and View the Application**

    After starting the development server, open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app in action.

### Build and Deploy (Optional)

If you want to prepare the app for production or deploy it to a server, follow these additional steps:

7. **Build for Production**

    To create a production-ready build of the app, which optimizes it for performance:

    - With npm:

        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```

    - With Yarn:
        ```bash
        yarn build
        ```

    This command generates static files that are ready to be deployed.

8. **Start the Production Server**

    To run the production build of the app:

    - With npm:

        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

    - With Yarn:
        ```bash
        yarn start
        ```

    This starts the server using the optimized production build.

9. **Deploy to Vercel**

    To deploy your app, you can use Vercel‚Äôs deployment platform. You can either use the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/cli) or deploy directly through the Vercel dashboard. For an easy deployment experience, follow the instructions on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme). For more details, check the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run the Goooooals locally. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out or consult the provided documentation.

Feel free to adjust these instructions based on your specific setup or additional requirements!
